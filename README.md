# AnimAI-AI-Advanced-Animation

## Week 1 

To get started with this project, you’ll need a basic understanding of Python, some data science concepts, and a few key Python libraries. We suggest going through the files in the Python folder first—this will help you get comfortable with the language.

Once you’ve got the basics down, move on to the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) assignment. It’s a great way to get hands-on practice and start working with real data.

Also, make sure to learn and explore the following libraries:

NumPy – for working with arrays and performing numerical operations

Pandas – for handling and analyzing data

Scikit-learn (sklearn) – for machine learning and model building

Matplotlib – for creating visualizations (you’ll find a file uploaded with this name to help you out)
